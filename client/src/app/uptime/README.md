# Uptime Monitoring Dashboard

## Implementation Complete âœ…

The uptime monitoring dashboard UI has been implemented with the following features:

### Components Created:

1. **MonitorsTable** (`/components/uptime/MonitorsTable.tsx`)
   - Displays all monitors in a table format
   - Shows status orb, name, type, 7-day uptime bar, last ping, uptime %, and response time percentiles
   - Clickable rows for navigation to detail view (pending implementation)
   - Loading skeleton states

2. **StatusOrb** (`/components/uptime/StatusOrb.tsx`)
   - Visual indicator for monitor status (up/down/unknown)
   - Animated pulse effect for active statuses
   - Three sizes: sm, md, lg

3. **UptimeBar** (`/components/uptime/UptimeBar.tsx`)
   - 7-day colored bar visualization
   - Shows daily uptime status with tooltips
   - Color coding: green (up), yellow/orange/red (issues), gray (no data)

4. **API Hooks** (`/api/uptime/monitors.ts`)
   - `useMonitors`: Fetch all monitors
   - `useMonitor`: Fetch single monitor
   - `useMonitorStats`: Fetch monitor statistics
   - `useMonitorEvents`: Fetch monitor events

### Features:

- **Real-time Status**: Shows current monitor status with animated indicators
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays P50, P75, P90, P99 response times
- **7-Day History**: Visual representation of monitor uptime over the past week
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Dark Mode**: Fully styled for dark theme

### Next Steps:

1. Create monitor detail view page
2. Add monitor creation/edit dialog
3. Implement monitor deletion
4. Add real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE
5. Add alerting configuration UI

### Usage:

Navigate to `/uptime` to see the dashboard. The table will automatically fetch and display all monitors for the current user's organizations.
