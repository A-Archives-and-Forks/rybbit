If there is only one value, the filter produces a single condition. If there are multiple values, they are combined using the OR operator to allow matching any of the provided values.

The allowable values for each possible parameter are described below.

- browser:
    - Description: A string extracted from the User-Agent header representing the browser name.
    - Examples: "Chrome", "Safari", "Edge", "Firefox".
- operating_system:
    - Description: A string representing the operating system from the User-Agent header.
    - Examples: "Windows", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "iOS".
- device_type:
    - Description: A string that indicates the type of device accessing the site.
    - Allowed Values: "Desktop", "Mobile", or "Tablet".
    - Notes: This is a closed set, so only these three values are acceptable.
- dimensions:
    - Description: A string representing the display resolution in the format "widthxheight".
    - Examples: "1920x1080", "1366x768".
- language:
    - Description: A string conforming to IETF BCP 47 language tags.
    - Examples: "en-US", "en-GB", "fr-FR", or simply "en", "fr" if the region subtag is missing.
    - Notes: The language subtag (e.g., "en", "fr") is always present, while the region subtag (e.g., "US", "GB") may be omitted if necessary.
- country:
    - Description: A string representing an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
    - Examples: "US", "CA", "GB", "FR".
    - Notes: This standard ensures that only valid two-letter country codes are accepted.
- iso_3166_2:
    - Description: A string representing an ISO 3166-2 code for country subdivisions.
    - Examples: "US-CA" (for California), "FR-IDF" (for ÃŽle-de-France).
    - Notes: This value follows a standardized format with a country code and a subdivision code separated by a hyphen.
- referrer:
    - Description: A string containing the URL returned by JavaScript's document.referrer.
    - Examples: "https://google.com/", "https://reddit.com/".
    - Notes: Since the referrer can be any valid URL, this value can be highly varied; typically, only the domain or full URL is used.
- pathname:
    - Description: A string representing the path portion of a URL, as returned by JavaScript's URL.pathname.
    - Examples: "/home", "/about", "/products/item-123".
    - Notes: This excludes the domain and query string, focusing only on the path structure.
- querystring:
    - Description: A string representing the query portion of a URL, as returned by JavaScript's URL.search.
    - Examples: "?q=search+term", "?page=2&sort=asc".
    - Notes: This includes the leading "?" and contains key-value pairs.
- page_title:
    - Description: A string representing the document title, as provided by JavaScript's document.title.
    - Examples: "Welcome to Our Site", "Product Details", "Contact Us".
    - Notes: This is typically a free-form text string that describes the page content.
- event_name:
    - Description: A custom string defined by the user, representing the name of an event.
    - Examples: "button_click", "form_submit", "video_play".
    - Notes: This is free-form text and may vary widely depending on the specific events being tracked.
- entry_page:
    - Description: A string representing the path portion of the URL where a session begins, extracted from the first pageview in a session.
    - Examples: "/landing", "/homepage".
    - Notes: It uses the same format as pathname but specifically denotes the entry point of the session.
- exit_page:
    - Description: A string representing the path portion of the URL where a session ends, extracted from the last pageview in a session.
    - Examples: "/checkout", "/thank-you".
    - Notes: Like entry_page, it follows the pathname structure but indicates the session's end page.`);
