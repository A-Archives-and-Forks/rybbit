# Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows you to add code snippets or tracking pixels to your website with minimal code changes. This makes it an efficient way to integrate Rybbit without modifying your codebase.

## How to Add Rybbit to Google Tag Manager

1. **Retrieve Your Rybbit Snippet**
   Navigate to your Rybbit project settings to obtain your JavaScript snippet.

2. **Access Your GTM Dashboard**
   Assuming GTM is already set up, go to your GTM dashboard and select the appropriate account and container linked to your website.

3. **Create a New Tag**
   Click on "Add a new tag" to initiate the creation process.

{/*    <Image */}
{/*      src="/images/gtm-dashboard.png" */}
{/*      alt="Google Tag Manager Dashboard" */}
{/*      width={800} */}
{/*      height={450} */}
{/*    /> */}

4. **Configure the Tag**
   Under "Tag Configuration," choose "Custom HTML" and paste your Rybbit snippet into the provided field.

{/*    <Image */}
{/*      src="/images/rybbit-snippet.png" */}
{/*      alt="Rybbit Snippet" */}
{/*      width={800} */}
{/*      height={450} */}
{/*    /> */}

5. **Set Up Triggers**
   Assign a trigger to determine when the tag should fire. For instance, to load Rybbit on all pages, select the "All Pages" trigger.

6. **Save and Publish**
   After configuring the tag and triggers, save your changes and publish the container to make the tag active on your website.
