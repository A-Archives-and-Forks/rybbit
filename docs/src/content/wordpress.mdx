# WordPress

You can integrate Rybbit into your WordPress site to track user behavior and gather analytics. There are several ways to do this depending on whether you're using a hosted WordPress.com site or a self-hosted WordPress.org installation.

## Option 1: Use a Plugin (No code)

If you don’t want to modify your theme files directly, you can use a plugin to inject the Rybbit snippet.

### Steps

1. Install a plugin such as **Insert Headers and Footers**.
2. Go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard → **Settings** → **Insert Headers and Footers**.
3. In the “Scripts in Header” field, paste your Rybbit snippet.
4. Save the changes.

## Option 2: Add to `functions.php`

If you're using a self-hosted WordPress theme, you can add the script via `functions.php`.

### Steps

1. In the WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance > Theme File Editor**.
2. Open the `functions.php` file.
3. Add this function:

```php
function add_Rybbit_script() {
  ?>
  <script src="YOUR_INSTANCE_ADDRESS" async data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
  <?php
}
add_action("wp_head", "add_Rybbit_script");
```
4. Save the file.

## Option 3: Modify `header.php`

You can also manually add the script into your theme’s HTML header.

### Steps

1. Go to **Appearance > Theme File Editor**.
2. Open the `header.php` file.
3. Paste the Rybbit snippet right before the closing `</head>` tag.
4. Replace the placeholder values with your API key and instance URL.
5. Save the file.
