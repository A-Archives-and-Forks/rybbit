# Self Hosting Frogstats

This guide will walk you through setting up your own instance of Frogstats.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-   **A Linux VPS:** We use [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=QEdVqVpTLBDP) for everything (referral link - but Hetzner is legitimately the best value). CX11 for ~$4/month will be fine for small-medium sized projects.
-   **A Domain Name:** You'll need a domain or subdomain (e.g., `tracking.yourdomain.com`) pointed to your VPS's IP address. HTTPS is required because browsers block tracking scripts served over insecure HTTP.
-   **Docker Engine:** Docker is used to run the application stack. Installation instructions are in Step 1.
-   **Git:** Needed to clone the repository.

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
### 1. Install Docker and Git

First, connect to your VPS via SSH.

**Install Docker Engine:** Follow the official instructions for your Linux distribution:
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Make sure to complete the [post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) as well, particularly adding your user to the `docker` group so you don't have to use `sudo` for every Docker command.

**Install Git:** If Git is not already installed, install it using your distribution's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
```

### 2. Clone the Frogstats Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goldflag/frogstats.git
cd frogstats
```

### 3. Run the Setup Script

The repository includes a setup script that configures the necessary environment variables (including generating a secure secret) and starts the application using Docker Compose.

Run the script, replacing `your.domain.name` with the domain or subdomain you configured in the prerequisites:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh your.domain.name
```

The script will create a `.env` file and then build and start the containers. This might take a few minutes the first time.

### 4. Sign Up

Once the services are running, Caddy (the webserver) will automatically obtain an SSL certificate for your domain.

Open your browser and navigate to `https://your.domain.name/signup` (using the domain you provided to the setup script).

Create your admin account. You can then log in and start adding your websites!

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully self-hosted Frogstats.
