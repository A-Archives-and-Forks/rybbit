2025-05-31 21:54:44 - Session Replay UI Components Implementation Completed

- Created Session Replay List Page at `client/src/app/[site]/replays/page.tsx`

  - Implements useGetReplaySessions hook for fetching replay sessions
  - Shows session metadata (timestamp, duration, user info, page views)
  - Includes pagination and user ID filtering capabilities
  - Displays overview cards with total sessions, average duration, and storage usage
  - Uses existing UI patterns and components (Table, Card, Button, etc.)

- Created Session Replay Player Page at `client/src/app/[site]/replays/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

  - Implements useGetReplaySession hook for fetching individual session data
  - Integrates rrweb-player for session playback functionality
  - Shows detailed session metadata and controls
  - Handles loading states and error conditions appropriately
  - Fixed TypeScript error with rrweb-player configuration

- Navigation already exists in sidebar (Replays link with Video icon)
- All imports use centralized exports from `client/src/api/analytics/replay.ts`
- Follows existing patterns from performance page and other analytics pages
- Uses proper TypeScript types throughout
- Handles loading states and errors appropriately

2025-05-31 22:03:23 - ReplayPlayer Component Migration to npm Package Completed

- **Task**: Fixed ReplayPlayer component to use npm-installed rrweb-player instead of CDN loading
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed all CDN loading logic (dynamic script/CSS injection)
  - Added proper npm imports for `Replayer` class and CSS styles
  - Updated TypeScript types for better type safety
  - Removed `rrwebLoaded` state and simplified component logic
  - Maintained all existing functionality and event handling
- **Result**: Component now uses reliable npm package with proper TypeScript support
- **File Updated**: `client/src/app/[site]/replays/components/ReplayPlayer.tsx`

2025-05-31 22:14:06 - Enhanced ClickHouse session_replay_metadata table with comprehensive metadata columns

- **Task**: Added 15 new metadata columns to session_replay_metadata table in ClickHouse schema
- **Columns Added**:
  - Geographic Data: country, region, city, lat, lon
  - Device/Browser Data: browser, browser_version, operating_system, operating_system_version, language, screen_width, screen_height, device_type
  - Session Context: channel, hostname, referrer
- **Implementation**: Used appropriate ClickHouse data types matching events table patterns (LowCardinality for categorical data, UInt16 for screen dimensions, Float64 for coordinates)
- **Impact**: Enables denormalized session replay queries without JOINs to events table, improving query performance
- **File Modified**: `server/src/db/clickhouse/clickhouse.ts`

2025-05-31 22:16:45 - Fixed rrweb-player API usage in ReplayPlayer component

- **Task**: Corrected incorrect import and usage of rrweb-player package to match TypeScript definitions
- **Changes Made**:
  - Fixed import statement to use correct default export `rrwebPlayer`
  - Updated TypeScript ref type to match the correct class
  - Corrected constructor call to use proper `{target, props: {events, ...}}` format
  - Updated all event listeners from `.on()` to `.addEventListener()` method
  - Fixed cleanup method from `.destroy()` to `.$destroy()` (Svelte component method)
- **Result**: ReplayPlayer component now uses the correct rrweb-player API and should function properly
- **File Updated**: `client/src/app/[site]/replays/components/ReplayPlayer.tsx`

2025-05-31 22:18:48 - Fixed ReplayPlayer cleanup logic to remove non-existent destroy methods

- **Task**: Removed calls to non-existent `destroy()` and `$destroy()` methods in ReplayPlayer component
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed `replayerRef.current.destroy?.()` call when clearing existing replayer (line 37)
  - Removed `replayerRef.current.$destroy?.()` call in cleanup effect (line 112)
  - Simplified cleanup logic to just clear container innerHTML and reset ref to null
  - Added explanatory comments about rrweb-player lifecycle management
- **Result**: Eliminates TypeScript errors and potential runtime issues, proper cleanup without calling non-existent methods
- **File Updated**: `client/src/app/[site]/replays/components/ReplayPlayer.tsx`

2025-05-31 22:42:00 - Added comprehensive session replay logging to tracking script

- **Task**: Enhanced script-full.js with detailed logging for session replay debugging
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Initialization Logging**: Added logs for replay enable/disable status, rrweb library loading success/failure
  - **Configuration Logging**: Added detailed logging of all replay configuration values (sample rate, max duration, mask settings, selectors)
  - **Sampling Decision Logging**: Enhanced shouldStartReplay() to log random value, sample rate, and decision result
  - **Recording Lifecycle Logging**: Added logs for rrweb.record() start, event emissions with type/timestamp, recording stop events
  - **Batching Logging**: Added logs when batching occurs (size threshold vs timeout), with event counts
  - **Network Logging**: Enhanced sendReplayEvents() with payload size, event count, URL, success/failure responses
  - **Error Logging**: Improved error logging with [REPLAY ERROR] prefix for all try/catch blocks
  - **Public API Logging**: Added logging for all public methods (startReplay, stopReplay, isReplayActive, getReplaySessionId) with current state
  - **Event Lifecycle Logging**: Added logs for page unload/hide events, max duration timeout, cleanup operations
- **Log Format**: Used consistent prefixes ([REPLAY], [REPLAY WARNING], [REPLAY ERROR]) with timestamps and context
- **Impact**: Provides complete visibility into session replay lifecycle to debug "nothing seems to be happening" issues
- **File Modified**: `server/public/script-full.js`
