# Hiding Your Own Traffic

There are several ways to disable Rybbit tracking to hide your own visits from analytics.

<Tabs items={['Browser Extensions', 'localStorage Method']}>
<Tab value="Browser Extensions">
**Browser Extensions (Recommended)**: The easiest way to disable tracking using community-maintained browser extensions.

### Available Extensions

- **[Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofnfdfidbkpellionhpmkejgaajieoo)**: Install from the Chrome Web Store
- **[Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rybbit-opt-out/)**: Install from Firefox Add-ons

These extensions automatically disable Rybbit tracking on all websites where you have Rybbit installed, without requiring any manual configuration.

<Callout type="info">
**Self-hosted users**: These extensions require Rybbit version 1.1.0 or higher. If you're running an older version, please update your installation or use the localStorage method.
</Callout>

*These extensions are community-maintained by [@davidfiala](https://github.com/davidfiala).*
</Tab>

<Tab value="localStorage Method">
**localStorage Method**: Manual configuration using your browser's developer console for more granular control.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open your browser's developer console

Press **F12** or right-click the page and select "Inspect"

Navigate to the "Console" tab
</Step>

<Step>
### Disable tracking

Enter this command to disable tracking:

```js
localStorage.setItem('disable-rybbit', 'true');
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Re-enable tracking (when needed)

If you want to re-enable tracking later, enter:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('disable-rybbit');
```
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Summary

Both methods are useful for developers testing sites or site owners who don't want to track their own visits:

- **Browser extensions** provide the most convenient solution, automatically working across all your Rybbit-enabled websites
- **localStorage method** offers more granular control for specific websites or temporary disabling

Once disabled through either method, the Rybbit script will not send any tracking data while preserving the API functions to prevent JavaScript errors.
